# Noita Glass Wand
It's a play on the vanilla perk Glass Cannon. Makes it so that your wand does 4x damage, 2x the explosion radius,
but has a chance to break when the player is taking damage. The chances are modifiable within the game's mod settings.
Can also choose if you want to start a run with the perk.

Stackable with the Glass Cannon perk.

## Installation
The mod can be found on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3228048249).

However, if you want to install it manually:

Go to Noita's game directory and place the downloaded files in the mods folder.
The mods folder on Steam is found here:
`Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods\`

Once in game, enable it through the mods menu.
